Schwartz.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with OCD as a child, and it was getting really annoying. Every day, many times throughout the day, I would have to deal with all sorts of dumb obsessive thoughts (e.g. that something bad would happen if I didn&amp;#39;t touch the doorknob a certain specific number of times) which I knew were stupid, but the only way to make them go away was to give in to the compulsion (e.g. to touch the doorknob like so). Problem was, each time I gave in, it would only make the loop stronger when it came back again. Every year it was only getting worse. I feared that it would one day take over my life completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, as a teenager, my mom found this book for me. Reading it completely changed my life. The book talks about what OCD is, how it works, and relays a bunch of personal stories of people suffering with it and, oh my god, some of them were so far gone, it was heartbreaking. I knew I had to do something to prevent myself from joining their unfortunate ranks. Thankfully, the book also included steps that one could take to learn to resist giving in to the compulsions, in order to gradually weaken the loop and, over time, ultimately break it entirely. There was hope!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the book outlines a form of cognitive behavioral therapy for sufferers of OCD. It wasn&amp;#39;t easy, but I forced myself to do it. Each time an obsessive thought entered my head, I would do my best to shove it aside, and not give in to the compulsion. I did not always succeed but, over time, I succeeded more and more, and it became easier and easier until, one day, I realized that I could barely hear those thoughts anymore at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, I am essentially OCD-free. The brain wiring is still there, but it&amp;#39;s such a minor part of me now that most of the time it doesn&amp;#39;t even register. The disorder no longer defines me. I got my life back, and am free. I owe it all to this book, its author Dr. Schwartz, and my mom for finding it for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You could pass each side-effectful function as a separate parameter, thus allowing a function to communicate exactly what it needs (no more, no less). The downside is you can end up with a function with 12 arguments. It also breaks abstraction, where function A suddenly decides it needs to do some new DB operation, and then functions B and C (where B calls A and C calls B) needs to add that function to their signatures as well. The repository pattern helps abstraction in this case by consolidating all functions A needs into a black box that B and C can take in and pass along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you could go even further to say instead of B directly importing and calling A, it should take in its own Repository object with an implementation of A. And you end up with never calling functions directly, you just always declare exactly what other functions are needed by this function. Which can be helpful for testing, but would be absolutely indirection hell when hooking things together. (Exceptions are a whole &amp;#39;nother thing that I&amp;#39;m figuring out with this pattern)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what you mean when you say &amp;quot;which feels a little backwards when the implementation already exists&amp;quot;.

										"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always wonder about the Repository pattern, both in OOP and FP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In OOP we often talk about SOLID. The &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; in SOLID is the interface segregation principle. AFAIU, the point is that a &amp;quot;client&amp;quot; should not be forced to take input or depend on functionality that it doesn&amp;#39;t need. So your interfaces need to be tailored to exactly what the calling code needs- nothing more and nothing less. Yet, we have things like Repository, which always have at least 4-5 methods (e.g. get-single, get-multiple, insert, replace, delete, etc). Many times the calling code doesn&amp;#39;t need to do all of the operations available on a Repository. In fact, quite often we only need the read operations. I&amp;#39;ve almost never seen code split Repository interfaces into ReadRepository, WriteRepository, and ReadWriteRepository, but I can imagine someone, somewhere, does that. But even then, you might not need all of the read functionality or all of the write functionality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A big part of the problem for many statically typed languages is twofold:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Objects/classes/types/values are nominally typed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You must declare adherence to an interface at the definition/instantiation of the class/type/value&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like this almost &lt;em&gt;forces&lt;/em&gt; developers to violate the interface segregation principle. How can the caller/client be the one in charge of declaring what it needs when your implementation of the dependency is the one that has to declare, upfront, everything that it does? What you end up doing is declaring an interface for the calling code and then going back and touching the implementation code to declare and implement that interface, which feels a little backwards when the implementation already exists (it actually makes perfect sense when you&amp;#39;re writing the impl from scratch).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s certainly much easier for the lazy dev to just think: &amp;quot;Well, I already have a FooRepository, and one of its methods is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; the API I want. I&amp;#39;ll just have this BarService take a FooRepository dependency.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The logical conclusion is to break up &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of your interfaces into single method interfaces. However, that sucks, too, because most languages don&amp;#39;t allow you to declare ad-hoc intersection types for parameters (some do, like Swift and TypeScript, but TypeScript is garbage so it doesn&amp;#39;t count ;) ). So you have to accept two parameters: &lt;code&gt;class BarService(getFoo: GetFooById, deleteFoo: DeleteFooById) {...}&lt;/code&gt;, which are likely to be the same instance being passed twice at construction, which also feels stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically all of that concern also applies to the FP realm. But I&amp;#39;m extra surprised that I keep seeing Repository interfaces show up in tutorials and blog posts about FP. That&amp;#39;s literally OOP, which is not necessarily &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; per se, but it&amp;#39;s just not FP. I concluded above that most interfaces should have a single method, but the obvious translation of that to FP is that your &amp;quot;interfaces&amp;quot; should just be functions. So, most of the time, I&amp;#39;d think you should just be passing exactly whatever functions you need as dependencies, rather than an object holding a bunch of functions as fields.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

So something like this\n```\nclass Person {\n  int id\n  string name\n}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;interface PersonRepo {\n  void insert(Person p)\n}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;class PersonRepoSql implements PersonRepo {\n  void insert(Person p) {\n    // implementation here\n  }\n}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;class PersonService {&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PersonRepo personRepo\n  PersonLogger personLogger&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;// injecting repo and what ever else here\n  PersonService(PersonRepo pRepo, PersonLogger pLogger) {\n    this.personRepo = pRepo\n    this.personLogger = pLogger\n  }&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;void createPerson(Person p) {\n    personLogger.log(&amp;quot;creating person&amp;quot;)\n    // ... any other operations\n    personRepo.insert(p) // &amp;lt;- calling your person repo that&amp;#39;s injected in\n  }\n```&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;since FP languages can accept functions as parameter you don&amp;#39;t need an interface to inject into a class you can simply do&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;createPerson :: Person -&amp;gt; IO () -- repo\n             -&amp;gt; String -&amp;gt; IO () -- logger\n             -&amp;gt; Person\n             -&amp;gt; IO ()\ncreatePerson insert log person = do\n  log &amp;quot;inserting person&amp;quot;\n  -- ... any other operations\n  insert person\n&lt;code&gt;\nif this seems like it messes up your function signature you can also put it into it&amp;#39;s own record\n&lt;/code&gt;\ndata CreatePersonDeps\n  = CreatePersonDeps\n  { insert :: Person -&amp;gt; IO ()\n  , log :: String -&amp;gt; IO ()\n  }&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;createPerson :: CreatePersonDeps -&amp;gt; Person -&amp;gt; IO ()\ncreatePerson deps person = do\n  log deps &amp;quot;inserting person&amp;quot;\n  -- ... any other operations\n  insert deps person\n&lt;code&gt;\nfinally there is also the reader monad which can clean up the signature more\n(keep in mind this is sudo code I may need to comeback and fix this)\n&lt;/code&gt;\ncreatePerson :: Person -&amp;gt; ReaderT CreatePersonDeps (IO ())\ncreatePerson person = runReaderT $ do\n  deps &amp;lt;- ask\n  log deps &amp;quot;inserting person&amp;quot;\n  -- ... any other operations\n  insert deps person\n```\nthis is a haskell example so in languages that I&amp;#39;m not sure can support the reader monad you could use the 2nd method to inject your dependencies in.  To test these you&amp;#39;ll just need to create mocks of them and inject them in as if you would with your implementation.  In haskell you can use IORefs to get the count of how many times a function was called.  In languages that support FP and OO, I usually create a class that exposes the call counts and increment them when they are called then assert in the test that they were called the number of times that was desired.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This is what Dr Dre did with Snoop/Eminem and what Diddy did with Biggie/Mase&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with an array of talented producers, but maintain executive control over every production session. That way most of the songs at least feature you as a &amp;quot;co-producer&amp;quot; and you are still the executive producer on the album, even if you didn&amp;#39;t really create the music. If you look at the track list to Ready to Die, P Diddy did not actually produce any songs himself.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Repurpose hits from the 70s and 80s to create radio friendly singles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add in a couple skits/interludes as tracks and list yourself as producer, so you have some solo credits in terms of legal/billing/etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Release an album under your own name, but feature your rappers heavily since you aren&amp;#39;t actually a good rapper. Biggie/Mase were featured on every radio release from Diddy&amp;#39;s first album (except &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ll Be Missing You&amp;#39;). There were songs on The Chronic and 2001 that Dre didn&amp;#39;t even appear on.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have the other rappers ghostwrite all lyrics for you, but make minimal changes so you can share songwriting credit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difference is Dr Dre already had name recognition as a hip hop artist (despite not really being a rapper) from NWA. Diddy did not have the same name recognition, so he needed a way to get his name out there before releasing his own album - and that was by ad libbing over every Biggie verse and appearing in all the music videos, interviews, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Diddy is not a good rapper, even when others ghostwrite for him, and he is not a talented musician. He&amp;#39;s a brilliant marketer and networker who knows how to keep people talking about him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dre is &lt;del&gt;a very talented DJ&lt;/del&gt; one of the most gifted producers alive, but his primary talent is spotting &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; talent and bringing it into his production. He has people ghostwrite all his lyrics, but at least he has good delivery. Most of the music on 2001 was created by Mel-Man, Lord Finesse, Scott Storch and session musicians, but Dre put it all together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; This isn&amp;#39;t a knock on Dre or Diddy at all. Both of those guys worked their asses off to get where they did and they&amp;#39;re both geniuses. It&amp;#39;s just that, even though they are primarily known as &amp;quot;rappers&amp;quot;, there is a lot more to it than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P Diddy started as a back up dancer for the Fine Young Cannibals, and Dr Dre used to dress in sparkly outfits on stage: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9O-pUGsVM\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9O-pUGsVM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Rapping about money drugs and luxury was almost all rap was in the early to the late 2000’s. Besides Eminem and a couple other guys, all there was to find was gangster rap about money rims and bitches. But most of those rappers did it without any soul, the deep type of soul that Biggie had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It hadn’t been until the early-aughts with guys like Kendrick who have something more akin to 2pac’s style with a lot of philosophical rhymes came back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s been interesting to watch. While there was some great stuff produced in the 2000’s, by guys like Ludacris and T.I.  and Nelly, and early 50 Cent, and of course Outkast, but I also consider it hip-hop’s worst quality years with guys like Lil Flip being superstars.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Biggie came up at a time that was common and in New York was obviously one of the best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind he literally was competing against Nas, Busta Rymes, and Jay Z in the Highschool Cafeteria. They would all participate in this tradition. When they weren&amp;#39;t all together and they were working the corner they would be slinging. Biggie made a name for himself and his operation made more money than he did from his albums.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any good neighborhood had their corner boy that had really good flow. New York in the early 90&amp;#39;s had the BEST. It was due in no small part to an insane amount of practice. These guys would be free style rapping every singe day for hours. Just as often as not around others who helped them refine their skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
