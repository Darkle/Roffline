<p>My question is what's the alternative to this pattern in FP? it could be an example in any FP language, I just need to have an idea if in FP are other patterns or techniques to achieve this or maybe you are using the same pattern?</p>

<p>PD: If you could refer me to existing codebases as example it'd be great.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
